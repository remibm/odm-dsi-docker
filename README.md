# Run ODM DSI Runtime on Docker

This page shows you how to run a single DSI Runtime on Docker. For some additional usage scenarios, like creating a volume to persist your solutions, see the [advance.md](dsi-runtime/docs/advance.md) documentation.

## Prerequisites

ODM DSI Runtime on Docker works on MacOS or Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64-bit. You can also use any Linux VM.
Before you start, install the following software:
* [IBM ODM Decision Server Insights V8.10.2](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQP76_8.10.2/com.ibm.odm.itoa/topics/odm_itoa.html)
* [Docker 18.09.0](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)
* Docker Compose 1.23.2
* Curl 7.47.0

Note: To be able to create the Docker image you must have an installation of IBM ODM Decision Server Insights V8.10.2.

OK, let's continue...

## Build the Docker image

### Clone the Github resources

The source materials are available on Github in this
GIT repository: https://github.com/ODMDev/odm-dsi-docker.

Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
Get the source files from Github over the SSH transfer protocol by typing:

``
git clone https://github.com/ODMDev/odm-dsi-docker.git
``

In the following document:
 * `DSI_DOCKER_GIT` designates the directory containing the working copy of
   this GIT repository.
 * `DSI_HOME` designates the directory containing the installation of ODM DSI V8.10.2.

### Create the Docker image

The Docker image can be produced by running the script 'build.sh'. Pass the path of the ODM installation directory as the first
argument. For example:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime
./build.sh $DSI_HOME
```

The output ends with:

```
The docker image dsi-runtime has been created.
```

The command `docker images` can be used to verify that the image is listed in the local registry of Docker.

### Set up on MacOS

On MacOS, the image uses the IBM JDK from the 'ibmjava' image, which might be different to the one supported by DSI Runtime.

The name of this image is `dsi-runtime-ibmjava` instead of `dsi-runtime`.
Before using docker-compose, set the environment variable `DSI_IMAGE` to `dsi-runtime-ibmjava` in the `.env` file.

To run containers or clusters on MacOS, increase the default values for the CPU and memory in the Docker menu `Preferences > Advanced`.
The Docker memory setting must be consistent with the DSI container max memory heap (`-Xmx`) and actual memory use.
For a DSI Runtime using its default settings, assign at least 2Gb for each `dsi-runtime-ibmjava` container.

## Run a single DSI runtime with Docker Compose

```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime
docker-compose up
```

When DSI is started, the output ends with the following lines:
```
[AUDIT   ] CWWKF0011I: The server dsi-runtime-single is ready to run a smarter planet.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/ibm/ia/debug/
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/ibm/ia/gateway/
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/IBMJMXConnectorREST/
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/ibm/ia/rest/
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/ibm/insights/
```

REST APIs are available by default on host port 9080 with HTTP and on port 9443 with HTTPS.
To change the host ports, edit the `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT` variables in the `.env` file.

## Test the DSI Runtime on Docker

### Deploy a solution

To deploy a solution and the connectivity configuration,
use the command line tools `solutionManager` and `connectivityManager`.

You can also deploy the solution by using a DSI runtime container. For more information see [advance.md](dsi-runtime/docs/advance.md).
The script `solution_deploy.sh` is provided to deploy solutions this way.

To run the script, open a separate command shell to the one you used to run the DSI container and type the following commands:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/dsi-runtime/samples/simple
./solution_deploy.sh $DSI_IP $DSI_PORT
```

The first argument `DSI_IP` is the IP address or the hostname of the DSI
Runtime. The commands run in the Docker container, so it is not possible
to use the `localhost` or the loopback addresses.

There are a number of ways you can determine the IP address of a container:
* `docker inspect dsiruntime_dsi-runtime_1`
* `docker exec dsiruntime_dsi-runtime_1 hostname -i`


The second argument `DSI_PORT` is the port of the DSI Runtime. By default,
it is `9443`.

The output of the script includes the following information:
```
Solution successfully deployed.
CWMBE1146I: Reading the input file: ./simple_solution-0.0.esa
CWMBE1475I: The connectivity server configuration file for the solution "simple_solution" contains the configuration required for the specified endpoints.
CWMBE1148I: Writing to the output file: /tmp/simple_solution-inbound.ear7303141339821942454.tmp
CWMBE1452I: Successfully deployed connectivity for the solution "simple_solution".
CWMBE1498I: Number of active inbound endpoints: 1
CWMBE1499I: Number of active outbound endpoints: 0
```

The DSI runtime console also displays a message about the solution:
```
[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0017I: The server configuration was successfully updated in 0.407 seconds.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKF0012I: The server installed the following features: [usr:simple_solution-0.0].
[AUDIT   ] CWWKF0008I: Feature update completed in 0.402 seconds.
[AUDIT   ] CWMBD0055I: Solution simple_solution-0.0 installed.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0016I: Starting server configuration update.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0028A: Processing included configuration resource: /opt/dsi/runtime/wlp/usr/servers/cisDev/simple_solution-config.xml
[AUDIT   ] CWWKG0017I: The server configuration was successfully updated in 0.040 seconds.
[AUDIT   ] CWWKT0016I: Web application available (default_host): http://58de6092c19c:9080/in/
[AUDIT   ] CWWKZ0001I: Application simple_solution-inbound started in 0.097 seconds.
[AUDIT   ] CWMBD0060I: Solution simple_solution-0.0 ready.
```

### Check that the solution is deployed

Open the URL https://localhost:9443/ibm/ia/rest/solutions/simple_solution/.

The REST command returns the following data:

```xml
<object type="com.ibm.ia.admin.solution.Solution">
        <attribute name="entityTypes">
                <collection type="entityTypes">
                        <string>simple.Person</string>
                </collection>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="eventTypes">
                <collection type="eventTypes">
                        <string>simple.SayHello</string>
                        <string>simple.CreatePerson</string>
                        <string>simple.Message</string>
                </collection>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="name">
                <string>simple_solution</string>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="timeZone">
                <object type="java.time.ZoneId">UTC</object>
        </attribute>
</object>
```

### Send an event

To create an entity of type `simple.Person`, an event of type `simple.CreatePerson` can be sent by using REST API calls to the DSI runtime.

The script `create_person.sh` does this for you:
```sh
cd $DSI_DOCKER_GIT/samples/simple
./create_person.sh localhost
```

The first argument is the hostname of the DSI runtime.

### Check the entity is created

The `create_person.sh` script creates an entity instance of `simple.Person`.

Open the URL https://localhost:9443/ibm/ia/rest/solutions/simple_solution/entity-types/simple.Person.

The REST command returns the following data:

```xml
<object xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns="http://www.ibm.com/ia/Entity" type="Collection[simple.Person]">
  <attribute name="entities">
    <collection>
      <object type="simple.Person">
        <attribute name="$CreationTime">
          <null/>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="$IdAttrib">
          <string>name</string>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="description">
          <string>  </string>
        </attribute>
        <attribute name="name">
          <string>jean</string>
        </attribute>
      </object>
    </collection>
  </attribute>
</object>
```
